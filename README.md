#Arduino data logger sketch

Sketch connects Arduino Uno to a wifi shield, two 1-wire temperature sensors and an I2C based sensor (BME280).

Data is published to a mosquitto server using the mqtt protocol.

As I'm a novice, please feel free to contribute any code modifications you think might be appropriate.

I have removed some of the code origins, but would like to get this down further to improve the available memory.
